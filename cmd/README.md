# `/cmd`

Main applications for this project.

The directory name for each application should match the name of the executable you want to have (e.g., `/cmd/myapp`).

Don't put a lot of code in the application directory. If you think the code can be imported and used in other projects, then it should live in the `/pkg` directory. If the code is not reusable or if you don't want others to reuse it, put that code in the `/internal` directory. You'll be surprised what others will do, so be explicit about your intentions!

It's common to have a small `main` function that imports and invokes the code from the `/internal` and `/pkg` directories and nothing else.

Examples:

* https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/tree/main/cmd (just a really small `main` function with everything else in packages)
* https://github.com/moby/moby/tree/master/cmd
* https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/tree/main/cmd
* https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/tree/master/cmd
