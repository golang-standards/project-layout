# `/test`

Additional external test apps and test data. Feel free to structure the `/test` directory anyway you want. For bigger projects it makes sense to have a data subdirectory. For example, you can have `/test/data` or `/test/testdata` if you need Go to ignore what's in that directory. Note that Go will also ignore directories or files that begin with "." or "_", so you have more flexibility in terms of how you name your test data directory.

Examples:

* https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/test (test data is in the `/testdata` subdirectory)
* https://github.com/marmotedu/iam/tree/master/test
